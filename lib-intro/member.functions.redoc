It is unspecified whether any member functions in the [=Cpp] standard library
are defined as inline ([#dcl.inline]).
[:zh_CN]
[=Cpp] 标准程序库中的任何成员函数是否被定义为内联（[#dcl.inline]）是未指明的。

[:en]
For a non-virtual member function described in the [=Cpp] standard library,
an implementation may declare a different set of member function signatures,
provided that any call to the member function that would select an overload from
the set of declarations described in this document behaves as if that overload
were selected.
[:zh_CN]
对于在 [=Cpp] 标准程序库中所描述的非虚成员函数，实现可以声明一组不同的成员函数
签名，只要任何对这个成员函数的调用从本文档所描述的声明式的集合中所选择的重载，
都表现为如同这个重载被选择一样即可。

[begin:note]
[:en]
For instance, an implementation can add parameters with default values,
or replace a member function with default arguments with two or more member
functions with equivalent behavior, or add additional signatures for a member
function name.
[:zh_CN]
例如，实现可以添加带有默认值的形参，或者把带有默认实参的一个成员函数替换为两个或
更多具有等价行为的成员函数，或者为某个成员函数名字添加额外的签名。
